## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with `flutter create <app_name>`. Of course, make sure you already have flutter on your machine, follow [this](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) guideline to getting start with flutter.

### How to use

Step 1:

Download or clone this repo by using the link below:

```
git clone https://github.com/ahmadichsan/flutter_assignment_1.git
```

Step 2:

Go to project root and execute the following command to get the required dependencies:

```
cd flutter_assignment_1
flutter pub get
```

Step 3:

Run the application:

```
flutter run
```

Perhaps, you want to run the application on both Android emulator and iOS simulator at the same time, you can read [this](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/running-a-flutter-app-on-ios-and-android-emulators/) article to get it done.
